# Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

---

<a name="introduction"></a>
# Introduction

In the first ten articles of this series, we discussed the foundational concepts of Spring WebFlux, including Reactor, error handling, data flow transformation, reactive database access, performance optimization, security, testing, and deployment. In this article, we will summarize the best practices for developing Spring WebFlux applications and highlight common pitfalls to help developers build more robust and efficient reactive systems.

<a name="best-practices"></a>
# Best Practices

<a name="proper-use-of-mono-and-flux"></a>
## 1. Proper Use of Mono and Flux

- **Mono**: Used for handling asynchronous sequences containing a single element or none. For example, when querying a database for a single user object.
- **Flux**: Used for handling asynchronous sequences containing multiple elements. For example, retrieving multiple user objects from a database.

Ensure that **Mono** and **Flux** are used in appropriate contexts to keep the code simple and readable.

```java
public Mono<User> findUserById(String id) {
    return userRepository.findById(id);
}

public Flux<User> findAllUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
}
```

<a name="error-handling"></a>
## 2. Error Handling

- **onErrorReturn**: Returns a default value when an error occurs.
- **onErrorResume**: Switches to another `Publisher` upon encountering an error.
- **onErrorMap**: Transforms one type of error into another.

These operators can be used to handle errors gracefully and ensure the application recovers from failures efficiently.

```java
public Mono<User> findUserById(String id) {
    return userRepository.findById(id)
            .onErrorReturn(new User("default", "Default User"));
}
```

<a name="backpressure-management"></a>
## 3. Backpressure Management

In high-concurrency environments, managing **backpressure** is critical to maintaining system stability. Operators like `limitRate`, `onBackpressureBuffer`, and `onBackpressureDrop` help control the flow of data to prevent overloading.

```java
public Flux<User> getUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll()
            .limitRate(100)
            .onBackpressureBuffer(50);
}
```

<a name="non-blocking-io-operations"></a>
## 4. Non-blocking I/O Operations

Ensure that all I/O operations are non-blocking. Avoid using blocking APIs such as `RestTemplate`, and instead use **WebClient** for HTTP requests.

```java
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

public class UserService {
    private final WebClient webClient = WebClient.create("http://example.com");

    public Mono<User> getUser(String id) {
        return webClient.get()
                .uri("/users/{id}", id)
                .retrieve()
                .bodyToMono(User.class);
    }
}
```

WebClient provides an efficient and reactive way to make HTTP calls without blocking the thread.

<a name="proper-thread-model-configuration"></a>
## 5. Proper Thread Model Configuration

Adjust Reactor and Netty thread configurations based on application requirements to optimize performance in high-concurrency environments.

```properties
reactor.netty.ioWorkerCount=16
```

Fine-tuning the thread pool ensures the application can handle more requests efficiently under high loads.

<a name="common-pitfalls"></a>
# Common Pitfalls

<a name="blocking-operations"></a>
## 1. Blocking Operations

Avoid using **blocking operations** in reactive programming, such as thread sleeps or blocking database queries. Blocking calls reduce system performance by causing threads to wait unnecessarily.

```java
public Mono<User> findUserById(String id) {
    // Avoid using blocking calls
    return Mono.fromCallable(() -> {
        Thread.sleep(1000); // This is a blocking call
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    });
}
```

Blocking operations can be detrimental in a reactive context, where non-blocking operations are essential for throughput.

<a name="ignoring-error-handling"></a>
## 2. Ignoring Error Handling

Ignoring error handling in reactive streams can lead to application crashes when exceptions occur. Ensure that potential errors are handled at every stage of the stream.

```java
public Mono<User> findUserById(String id) {
    return userRepository.findById(id)
            .onErrorResume(e -> {
                log.error("Error occurred", e);
                return Mono.empty();
            });
}
```

Proper error handling ensures the system remains resilient under failure conditions.

<a name="resource-leaks"></a>
## 3. Resource Leaks

Ensure that resources such as files, database connections, or network sockets are properly closed after usage to avoid **resource leaks**. For instance, when handling file streams, ensure the file is closed after processing.

```java
public Flux<String> readFile(String path) {
    return Flux.using(
            () -> Files.lines(Paths.get(path)),
            Flux::fromStream,
            Stream::close
    );
}
```

Using the `Flux.using` construct ensures that resources are cleaned up when no longer needed.

<a name="over-reliance-on-default-configurations"></a>
## 4. Over-reliance on Default Configurations

While Spring Boot provides many default configurations, relying on them in a production environment can be risky. Adjust configurations such as **Netty thread count** and **database connection pool size** based on the specific needs of your application.

```properties
spring.r2dbc.pool.initialSize=10
spring.r2dbc.pool.maxSize=50
```

By customizing these settings, you can optimize resource usage and ensure smooth scaling under different load conditions.

# Conclusion

In this article, we summarized the best practices for developing Spring WebFlux applications and highlighted common pitfalls to avoid during development. By following these practices and avoiding common mistakes, developers can build more robust, scalable, and efficient reactive applications.

Staying mindful of performance, error handling, and resource management while leveraging reactive programming concepts will lead to high-performing, non-blocking systems capable of handling large volumes of traffic efficiently.
