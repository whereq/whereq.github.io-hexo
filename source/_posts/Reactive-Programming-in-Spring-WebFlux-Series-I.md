# Overview and Fundamentals

<a name="what-is-reactive-programming"></a> 
## What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a programming paradigm oriented around data flows and the propagation of changes. Unlike traditional imperative programming, reactive programming allows you to declare data dependencies, and changes are automatically propagated when the data source changes. The core idea of reactive programming involves asynchronous data stream processing and non-blocking operations, making applications more efficient in utilizing system resources.

## Why Choose Spring WebFlux?

Spring WebFlux is an asynchronous, non-blocking web framework introduced in Spring 5 that handles non-blocking asynchronous requests. Unlike traditional Spring MVC, Spring WebFlux is built on the Reactive Streams specification and supports a fully non-blocking reactive programming model. Some key reasons to choose Spring WebFlux include:

- **Non-blocking I/O**: Allows handling of more concurrent requests, improving system throughput and response times.
- **Reactive Programming Model**: Offers reactive programming support based on Project Reactor, making the code more concise and maintainable.
- **Flexible Programming Model**: Supports both annotation-driven and functional programming models, catering to different developer needs.
- **High Scalability**: Ideal for microservices and distributed systems, making it easy to scale and integrate.

## Core Concepts and Components

<a name="1-reactive-streams"></a> 
### 1. Reactive Streams
Reactive Streams is the foundation of reactive programming, defining the standards for asynchronous stream processing. It consists of four core interfaces:

- **Publisher**: Responsible for producing data.
- **Subscriber**: Consumes data.
- **Subscription**: Manages the relationship between publishers and subscribers.
- **Processor**: Acts as both a publisher and a subscriber.

<a name="2-project-reactor"></a> 
### 2. Project Reactor
Project Reactor is the underlying implementation for Spring WebFlux, providing support for reactive streams. It has two main types:

- **Mono**: Represents an asynchronous sequence of 0 or 1 element.
- **Flux**: Represents an asynchronous sequence of 0 to N elements.

<a name="3-webflux"></a> 
### 3. WebFlux
Spring WebFlux is an asynchronous, non-blocking web framework based on Reactive Streams API and Project Reactor. The main components include:

- **Router Functions**: Define mappings between requests and handlers in a functional style.
- **Handler Functions**: Handle HTTP requests and return responses.

## Practical Example: Building a Simple WebFlux Application

<a name="1-project-setup"></a> 
### 1. Project Setup

Start by creating a Spring Boot project and adding the necessary dependencies:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
        <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

<a name="2-define-data-model"></a> 
### 2. Define Data Model

Define a simple user data model:

```java
public class User {
    private String id;
    private String name;

    // Constructors, Getters and Setters
}
```

<a name="3-create-handler-and-router"></a> 
### 3. Create Handler and Router

Create a handler function and a router function:

```java
@Component
public class UserHandler {
    public Mono<ServerResponse> getUser(ServerRequest request) {
        User user = new User("1", "John Doe");
        return ServerResponse.ok().body(Mono.just(user), User.class);
    }
}

@Configuration
public class RouterConfig {
    @Bean
    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route(UserHandler handler) {
        return RouterFunctions.route(RequestPredicates.GET("/user"), handler::getUser);
    }
}
```
