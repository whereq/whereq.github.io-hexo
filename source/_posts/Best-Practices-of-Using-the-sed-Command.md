## Introduction

The `sed` command is a powerful stream editor for filtering and transforming text in Unix-like operating systems. It is particularly useful for performing search-and-replace operations, deleting lines, and modifying text files. This article provides a comprehensive guide to the best practices of using the `sed` command, covering various scenarios such as substitution, pattern matching, in-place editing, and combining `sed` with other commands using pipelines.

<a name="basic-usage"></a>
## Basic Usage

### <a name="substitution"></a> Substitution

To replace a pattern with another string, use the `s` command:

```bash
sed 's/old/new/' filename.txt
```

This command replaces the first occurrence of `old` with `new` in each line.

### <a name="deleting-lines"></a> Deleting Lines

To delete lines that match a pattern, use the `d` command:

```bash
sed '/pattern/d' filename.txt
```

This command deletes all lines containing the pattern.

### <a name="printing-lines"></a> Printing Lines

To print lines that match a pattern, use the `p` command:

```bash
sed -n '/pattern/p' filename.txt
```

This command prints all lines containing the pattern.

<a name="advanced-usage"></a>
## Advanced Usage

### <a name="pattern-matching"></a> Pattern Matching

To match patterns using regular expressions, use the `s` command with regex:

```bash
sed 's/[0-9]+/number/' filename.txt
```

This command replaces all sequences of digits with the word `number`.

### <a name="in-place-editing"></a> In-Place Editing

To edit a file in place, use the `-i` option:

```bash
sed -i 's/old/new/' filename.txt
```

This command replaces `old` with `new` in the file `filename.txt` and saves the changes.

### <a name="multiple-commands"></a> Multiple Commands

To execute multiple commands, use the `-e` option:

```bash
sed -e 's/old/new/' -e '/pattern/d' filename.txt
```

This command replaces `old` with `new` and deletes lines containing `pattern`.

### <a name="address-ranges"></a> Address Ranges

To apply commands to specific lines or ranges of lines, use address ranges:

```bash
sed '1,3s/old/new/' filename.txt
```

This command replaces `old` with `new` in lines 1 to 3.

---

<a name="combining-with-other-commands"></a>
## Combining with Other Commands

### <a name="using-sed-with-grep"></a> Using `sed` with `grep`

To combine `sed` with `grep`, use a pipeline:

```bash
grep "pattern" filename.txt | sed 's/old/new/'
```

This command first filters lines containing `pattern` and then replaces `old` with `new`.

### <a name="using-sed-with-awk"></a> Using `sed` with `awk`

To combine `sed` with `awk`, use a pipeline:

```bash
awk '{print $1}' filename.txt | sed 's/old/new/'
```

This command first prints the first field of each line and then replaces `old` with `new`.

### <a name="using-sed-with-find"></a> Using `sed` with `find`

To combine `sed` with `find`, use a pipeline:

```bash
find /path/to/search -name "*.log" -exec sed -i 's/old/new/' {} \;
```

This command finds all `.log` files and replaces `old` with `new` in each file.

<a name="advanced-scenarios"></a>
## Advanced Scenarios

### <a name="inserting-text"></a> Inserting Text

To insert text before or after a pattern, use the `i` or `a` command:

```bash
sed '/pattern/i\Insert this line before pattern' filename.txt
sed '/pattern/a\Append this line after pattern' filename.txt
```

### <a name="appending-text"></a> Appending Text

To append text to the end of a line, use the `s` command with a `&` to reference the matched pattern:

```bash
sed 's/pattern/& append/' filename.txt
```

This command appends ` append` to the end of lines containing `pattern`.

### <a name="replacing-multiple-patterns"></a> Replacing Multiple Patterns

To replace multiple patterns, use multiple `s` commands:

```bash
sed 's/old1/new1/; s/old2/new2/' filename.txt
```

This command replaces `old1` with `new1` and `old2` with `new2`.
